Assignment 1: Apriori Analysis

objective: To calculate time complexity of following codes

//code 1:
 i = n;
while (i > 2):
    i = i**1/21**k
    print(i);

//Solution:
let k be number of times the loop runs, thus it will run till :- 
    n**1/21**k = 2
    on solving the above equation we get the time complexity as O(log(log(n)));



code 2:
i = 29;
while(i < n):
    i = i**23
    print(i)

//Solution:
let k be number of times the loop runs, thus it will run till :- 
    29**23**k = n
    on solving the above equation we get the time complexity as O(log(log(n)));
    

code 3:
i = 1
while(i < n):
    i = 2 * i
    i = 3 * i

//Solution:
let k be number of times the loop runs, thus it will run till :- 
    6**k = n
    on solving the above equation we get the time complexity as O(log(n));
